# HYPRSETTINGS
A simple Control Panel designed for Hyprland. This project is for my own dotfiles but is open for everyone to use in their projects.

# OVERVIEW
This program is helpful for managing screen brightness, wallpaper, audio, and for fun, system information.

> bugfixes for now,

> and install with *make*
